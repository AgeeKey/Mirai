# üå∏ MIRAI Autonomous Agent - Vision & Scope Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Phase 0 - Discovery  
**Owner:** MIRAI Development Team

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

MIRAI is a locally/cloud-deployable, autonomous, and secure AI agent designed to revolutionize task automation and software development. The system integrates task planning, browser/software automation (RPA), code execution, data collection/processing, memory storage/retrieval (RAG), and workflow execution capabilities - all while maintaining manageability, testability, and production scalability.

**Vision Statement:**
> Build an intelligent, autonomous agent that can think, learn, act, and evolve - transforming how humans interact with software systems while maintaining security, reliability, and ethical boundaries.

## üîê Security & Compliance

### Security Requirements
- **Policy Engine**: YAML-driven rules for allowed/prohibited actions
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Docker-based isolation for code execution
- **Token Authentication**: Secure API access with rotation
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action history for forensic analysis
- **Panic Stop**: Emergency shutdown mechanism
- **Secret Management**: Vault integration, no secrets in code

### Compliance Considerations
- **Data Retention Policy**: Configurable memory persistence duration
- **User Consent**: Opt-in for data collection, opt-out available
- **Privacy Controls**: No external data transmission without approval
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly pen tests and vulnerability assessments
- **GDPR/CCPA Ready**: Data export and deletion capabilities

---

## üìä Technical Constraints

### Resource Requirements
- **Compute**: 2-4 CPU cores, 4-8GB RAM for local deployment
- **Storage**: 10GB minimum (databases, logs, knowledge base)
- **Network**: Stable internet for AI API calls (optional offline mode)
- **OS Support**: Linux (primary), macOS (supported), Windows (experimental)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI, asyncio
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, sentence-transformers (embeddings)
- **Automation**: Playwright (browser), pyautogui (desktop)
- **Storage**: SQLite (default), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana (optional)
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (enterprise deployment)

### Limitations
- AI model dependency (external API or local model required)
- Browser automation limited by anti-bot measures (captchas)
- Code execution risks require sandboxing
- Token costs for cloud AI models
- DOM changes can break RPA selectors

---

## üöÄ High-Level Approach

### Development Methodology
- **Agile/Scrum**: 2-week sprints with demos
- **Quarterly Roadmaps**: Strategic planning and review
- **Definition of Done**: Code + Tests + Docs + Infra + Runbook
- **Guilds**: Cross-team collaboration (Architecture, Security, RPA)

### Risk Management Strategy
- **Unpredictable agent actions**: Policy engine + manual approval + sandbox
- **Website blocking/captchas**: API fallbacks + human-in-the-loop
- **Secret leaks**: Vault + audit logs + key rotation
- **Rising LLM costs**: Cost guards + model tiering + local fallback
- **DOM changes breaking RPA**: Selector maps + ML-based visual selectors + monitoring

### Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Critical module coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent task handling
- **Security Testing**: Penetration tests, fuzzing
- **Human Evaluation**: Annotation interface for output quality
