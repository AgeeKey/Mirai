3. **Error handling**:  
   - Improve error handling mechanisms throughout the project to ensure that potential issues are logged and addressed appropriately.

4. **Testing**:  
   - Implement unit tests for critical functionalities to ensure code reliability and facilitate future changes.
   
5. **Configuration management**:  
   - Consider utilizing environment variables for sensitive configurations like API keys instead of hardcoding them in files.

### Conclusion  
By addressing these areas, the project will become more maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly. Documentation improvements can significantly benefit new contributors and users.
