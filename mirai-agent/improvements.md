# Improvements for Mirai Agent Project

## 1. Update Dependencies
- Review the latest versions of dependencies and update requirements.txt accordingly.

## 2. Performance Optimization Utility
- Implement a utility for monitoring and optimizing FastAPI performance. This utility could include:
  - Endpoint response time tracking.
  - Middleware for logging requests and responses.
  - Recommendations for reducing latency.

## 3. Project Structure Best Practices
- Maintain clear modular separation (which already exists).
- Ensure each module has its own documentation and consistent interfaces.
- Use type hints and docstrings for better code readability.
- Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.

## Next Steps
- Execute the task to improve the structure and performance.
