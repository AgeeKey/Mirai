    "description": "Implement a machine learning model to enhance real-time market sentiment analysis by integrating news sentiment data and social media trends. This model should analyze and quantify sentiment shifts and correlate them with price movements, allowing Mirai to adjust trading strategies dynamically based on market psychology. Action steps include:\n\n1. **Data Acquisition**: Gather historical and real-time news articles, tweets, and forum posts related to stocks or commodities.\n2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use NLP techniques to create a sentiment scoring system that evaluates the tone of the data.\n3. **Backtesting**: Test the model against historical price movements to validate its predictive power.\n4. **Integration**: Incorporate the sentiment scores into the existing trading algorithm to influence decision-making processes.\n5. **Monitoring & Optimization**: Continuously monitor performance and refine the model based on feedback and results. \n\nThis task will enhance Mirai's ability to anticipate market movements and make informed trading decisions.",
