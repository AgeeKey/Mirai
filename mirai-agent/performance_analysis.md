# Performance Analysis

## Overview
The performance of the MIRAI agent can be assessed through various key metrics. Recommendations for enhancements based on initial data analysis:

### Key Metrics
1. **API Response Time**: Measure the average response time of the agent's API endpoints. Aim for less than 200ms for optimal user experience.
2. **Throughput**: Analyze the number of computations or trades processed per second. This metric helps in understanding scalability.
3. **Error Rates**: Monitor any API operational errors to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
4. **Resource Utilization**: Assess CPU and memory usage during peak operation hours to ensure optimal operation.

### Recommendations
- Implement caching strategies where applicable to reduce load times and external API calls.
- Optimize database queries and consider asynchronous operations to enhance throughput.
- Regularly profile the application using tools like `cProfile` and `memory_profiler` to identify performance bottlenecks.
